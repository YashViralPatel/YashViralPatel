- 👋 Hi, I’m @YashViralPatel
- 👀 I’m interested in all types of coding, programming and web designing. I started my journey into this arena of web technology on the 12th of September 2022. As of now, I am pretty new to all this. At the moment, I am planning to learn as much as I can before my FY starts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the bare basics of C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of now.
- 📫 How to reach me ...you can DM me or email me.

I am going to post the codes I write by myself as I learn stuff from open sources like youtube and other sites on Google. Everything I post though, will be written by me, completely by myself, on the basis of what I have learned and not by copy pasting things from someone else.
